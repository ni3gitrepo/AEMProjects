Two ways to create Folder
=============================

1)right click on  any root folder create folder or 

2)top icon on crxde click create> Node>create Node > type you can give nt:folder or sling:folder.


nt:folder vs sling:folder
===========================
    nt:folder can be used as a "vanilla" folder node in the JCR

    Using a sling:folder allows the folders children to be interpreted using their sling:resourceType â€” e.g.
    if you had a node "bar" at /etc/designs/foo/bar, setting the resource type of "foo" 
    to a sling:Folder allows you to resolve bar using its resource type via a script (just like with components), 
    whereas if "foo" were an nt:folder this wouldn't be possible (it would just be treated statically).

    sling:OrderedFolder can be used when ordering is important, e.g. in the /etc/map directory, if you want your 
    entries to be used in order rather than randomly, the ordered folder provides this option. (For most cases, it's not really needed.)
